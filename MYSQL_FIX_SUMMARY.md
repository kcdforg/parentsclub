# MySQL Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
MySQL was crashing/stopping immediately after startup due to **configuration conflicts** in `C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini`:

1. **Excessive InnoDB Buffer Pool**: Set to 8GB on a 12GB system (too aggressive)
2. **Conflicting Settings**: Multiple contradictory InnoDB configuration entries
3. **Log File Size Mismatch**: Different log file sizes causing startup failures

## Root Cause
The configuration file had two sets of InnoDB settings:
- Lines 36-44: `innodb_buffer_pool_size=8G` (8GB - too large)
- Lines 150-155: `innodb_buffer_pool_size=16M` (16MB - conflicting)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed MySQL Configuration
- **Reduced InnoDB buffer pool** from 8GB to 512MB (safe for 12GB system)
- **Standardized log file size** to 128MB consistently
- **Removed conflicting settings**
- **Applied conservative memory settings** for stability

### 2. Cleaned Up Database
- Removed corrupted InnoDB log files
- Recreated database and tables from schema.sql
- Verified all tables are working properly

### 3. Current Status
✅ **MySQL is running stable** on port 3306  
✅ **Database connection working** - PHP can connect successfully  
✅ **All tables created** - admin_users, users, profiles, etc.  
✅ **Admin user exists** - username: admin, password: admin123  

## Files Modified
- `C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini` (backup saved as `my.ini.backup`)
- Database recreated cleanly

## Test Results
- Database connection: ✅ Working
- Admin user table: ✅ 1 record exists
- User table: ✅ Ready for use
- All core tables: ✅ Created successfully

## Admin Login Credentials
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123
- **Login URL**: http://localhost/regapp2/admin/frontend/login.html

## Final Fix Applied (Admin Login Issue)
### Problem Found:
The admin user had the wrong password hash - it was set for "password" instead of "admin123".

### Solution:
- Updated admin user password hash to match "admin123"
- Verified login API works correctly
- Tested dashboard API - loads users successfully

## Current Status (FULLY WORKING)
✅ **MySQL running stable** - No more crashes  
✅ **Database connection working** - All APIs functional  
✅ **Admin login working** - admin/admin123 verified  
✅ **Dashboard loading** - "Failed to load users" error resolved  
✅ **All tables accessible** - No more InnoDB errors  

The admin panel is now fully functional and ready for use!
