# Registration Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing `user_type` Field in Database Schema**
- **Problem**: The `register.php` file was trying to insert a `user_type` field with value `'Registered'`, but the `users` table in the unified schema didn't have this field.
- **Fix**: Added the `user_type` field to the database schema and updated the INSERT statement to use `'registered'` as the correct value.
- **User Types Supported**: invited, registered, enrolled, approved, premium

### 2. **Non-existent `invitation_type` Field**
- **Problem**: The code was trying to access `$invitation['invitation_type']` which doesn't exist in the invitations table.
- **Fix**: Removed the cross-invite expiration logic that referenced this non-existent field.

### 3. **Non-existent `invited_phone` Field**
- **Problem**: The removed cross-invite expiration logic also referenced `invited_phone` field which doesn't exist.
- **Fix**: Removed all references to this field.

### 4. **Enhanced Error Logging**
- **Improvement**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the registration process to help debug future issues.
- **Added**: Logging for invitation validation, email validation, number generation, user creation, profile creation, invitation updates, and transaction status.

### 5. **Improved Error Handling**
- **Improvement**: Enhanced error messages to provide more specific information about what went wrong.
- **Added**: Better error handling for session creation failures and database transaction rollbacks.

### 6. **Frontend Debugging**
- **Improvement**: Added console logging to help debug frontend issues.
- **Added**: Logging for invitation checks, form data, and registration requests.

### 7. **Session Token Handling**
- **Improvement**: Made session token storage conditional to handle cases where session creation might fail.
- **Added**: Graceful fallback when session creation fails.

### 8. **Frontend UI Flash Issues**
- **Problem**: Invitation required message was flashing briefly before registration form loaded.
- **Fix**: Added `hidden` class to invitation required message by default to prevent flash.

### 9. **User Type System Implementation**
- **Problem**: Database schema was missing user_type field for the 5-tier user system.
- **Fix**: Added user_type ENUM field with values: invited, registered, enrolled, approved, premium.
- **Added**: Database migration script to safely add the column and update existing users.

### 10. **Phone Number Support Implementation**
- **Problem**: System only supported email-based invitations and login.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive phone number support throughout the system.
- **Added**: Phone fields in users and invitations tables, phone/email login support, phone auto-population in profiles.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Connection**: Use `test_registration.php` to verify database connectivity and table structure.
2. **Invitation Validation**: Ensure there are valid pending invitations in the database.
3. **Registration Flow**: Test the complete registration process with a valid invitation.
4. **Error Logs**: Check server error logs for any remaining issues.

## Database Schema Requirements

The registration process requires the following tables with correct structure:
- `users` - Main user accounts (with user_type and phone fields)
- `user_profiles` - User profile information
- `invitations` - Invitation codes and details (with phone support)
- `sessions` - User session management

## Phone Number Support

The system now supports:
- **Phone-based invitations**: Users can be invited via phone number
- **Phone/Email login**: Users can login with either phone or email
- **Auto-population**: Phone numbers automatically populate in profile completion
- **Flexible registration**: Users can register with email, phone, or both

## User Type System

The system now supports 5 user types:
1. **invited** - User has invitation code but hasn't registered yet
2. **registered** - User has set password through invitation (default for new registrations)
3. **enrolled** - User has completed profile but not yet approved
4. **approved** - User has been approved by admin
5. **premium** - User has active subscription

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migrations**: 
   - Execute `migrate_user_types.php` to add the user_type column
   - Execute `migrate_phone_support.php` to add phone number support
2. **Test Registration Process**: Test with valid invitations (email and phone) to ensure user_type is set correctly
3. **Test Phone/Email Login**: Verify users can login with either phone or email credentials
4. **Monitor Error Logs**: Check for any remaining issues
5. **Verify User Creation**: Ensure user accounts are created with correct user_type and phone support
6. **Check Invitation Status**: Verify invitations are properly marked as used
7. **Profile Completion**: Test profile completion to ensure user_type updates to 'enrolled' and phone auto-populates
8. **Admin Approval**: Test admin approval process to update user_type to 'approved'
